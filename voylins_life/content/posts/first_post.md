I have been working a lot on getting this new site sorted out because I'm trying to step away from using Wordpress as the performance was quite bad, and I'm not willing to spend any money on plugins for a site which already costs me hosting fees and a domain fee. (I don't earn anything with this site ^^")

In the next couple of months I'm planning on creating all previous posts that my old site had and after that I can finally get started on writing new posts with things about Japan, Japanese and our life.

So stay tuned! ;)
