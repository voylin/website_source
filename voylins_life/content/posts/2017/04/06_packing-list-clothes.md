# The Essentials: What Clothes You Need While Backpacking

*I am writing this article a lot later after making this video. This article will not be directly attached to this video but may still prove informative.*

When it comes to packing for a backpacking trip, it can be tempting to bring along every piece of clothing you own. However, it's important to remember that space and weight are limited, so it's important to be selective about the clothes you bring. Here are some essential items that you should consider packing for your next backpacking adventure.

# Comfortable and Durable Footwear

One of the most important items of clothing you'll need while backpacking is a comfortable and durable pair of shoes. You'll probably be doing a lot of walking, so it's crucial to have shoes that will support your feet and keep them comfortable, even after hours of walking. Look for shoes with good arch support and cushioning, and make sure they are broken in before your trip.

It's also a good idea to bring along a second pair of shoes, such as sandals or flip-flops, for use in camp or around town. Just make sure they fit nicely in your bay and don't increase the weight too much.

# Quick-Drying Clothes

Another essential item of clothing for backpacking is quick-drying clothes. When you're on the trail, you'll likely encounter rain, mud, and other wet conditions, so it's important to have clothes that will dry quickly and won't hold onto moisture. Look for synthetic materials, such as polyester and nylon, which are known for their quick-drying and moisture-wicking properties. Avoid cotton, which takes a long time to dry and can become uncomfortable when wet.

# Layering Pieces

Another key to staying comfortable while backpacking is layering. The weather can change quickly on the trail, so it's important to be prepared for a wide range of temperatures. Bring along a variety of lightweight and breathable layers, such as t-shirts, long-sleeved shirts, and lightweight jackets, that can be easily added or removed as needed. This will allow you to adjust to changing conditions, and keep you comfortable no matter what the weather brings.

# Versatile Accessories
In addition to the main items of clothing, there are also some versatile accessories that can be useful while backpacking. A hat or beanie can provide warmth and protection from the sun, while a scarf or buff can be used as a headband, neck warmer, or sun shade. A pair of gloves can also be useful for cold or wet weather, and a good pair of sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun's glare.

# Conclusion

Packing the right clothes for a backpacking trip is essential to staying comfortable and having a successful adventure. By bringing along comfortable and durable footwear, quick-drying clothes, layering pieces, and versatile accessories, you'll be prepared for whatever the trail throws your way.
