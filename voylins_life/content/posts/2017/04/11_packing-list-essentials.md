# The Importance of Packing Light

When it comes to long-term travel, the last thing you want to do is lug around a heavy suitcase. Not only is it a hassle to carry, but it can also limit your mobility. Instead, opt for a backpack that you can easily take with you on any adventure.

## The Best Way to Pack Your clothes

A good place to start packing your backpack is at the bottom. This will help to keep the body and underside of the bag more sturdy. Consider rolling up your clothes, rather than folding them, to save space. Your clothes can't break so it's a good way to put them on the bottom with the more break-able stuff on top. Just be sure that you put the items you need the most often are closer to the top. You don't want to have to take everything out every time.

## Protecting Your Electronics

Taking electronics whilst traveling is something I don't usually recommend, but we are in the age that people can't live without a phone and a camera. So if you pack those things, be certain to also pack your chargers and cables. If, for some reason, you need to carry a laptop inside of your backpack, then please make certain your backpack has a dedicated spot for it and that you don't over pack. the weight of all your items may put enough pressure on your laptops screen to break it.

## Weighing Your Bag

Before your trip, it's a good idea to weigh your backpack to make sure it meets the weight requirements of your airline or other modes of transportation. If it's a little bit over, try to remove some heavier items or pack them in a smaller bag that you can carry on. Another tip is, if you really need those items, to pack them into your coat. That only works if the items are small enough however.

## Maximizing Your Space

Even if you think you've packed everything you need, there's likely still room for souvenirs or other items you may pick up along the way. Consider packing items like jackets and sweatshirts on the outside of your bag to save space. And remember, it's always better to pack a little too light than a little too heavy.

If you find that you needed something, chances are high you can buy that whilst traveling. If you find out that you don't use certain things, then it would feel wasteful to throw them away, or to carry them along. It will become a burden.

# Conclusion

Packing your backpack for a long-term trip doesn't have to be stressful. By following these tips and being mindful of the weight and space in your bag, you can easily pack everything you need and still have room for souvenirs. Happy travels!
