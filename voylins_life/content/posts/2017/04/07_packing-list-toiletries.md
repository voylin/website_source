# The Essentials: Toiletries for Backpacking

*I am writing this article a lot later after making this video. This article will not be directly attached to this video but may still prove informative.*

When you're embarking on a backpacking trip, it's important to pack light and only bring the essentials. This is especially true when it comes to toiletries, as you'll need to make sure that you have everything you need to stay clean and healthy, without carrying too much weight. Here are the essential toiletries that you should bring on your backpacking trip.

# Soap

One of the most important toiletries to bring on a backpacking trip is soap. This will allow you to clean your hands, face, and body, and prevent the spread of germs. Look for a soap that is biodegradable and gentle on your skin, and that can be used for multiple purposes, such as shampoo and laundry detergent.

Having a soap for multiple purposes is quite helpful, also make certain the bottle is not too big else you may run into problems if you want to take your backpack as check-in luggage. When you are running out, try to find different options of what you have now in the country where you are at the time. Most of the time hostels and hotels have soaps available so running out is probably not something which will happen (often).

# Toothbrush and Toothpaste

Another essential toiletry is a toothbrush and toothpaste. Oral hygiene is important for maintaining overall health, and a good toothbrush and toothpaste will help you to keep your teeth and gums clean, even on the road. Look for a toothbrush that is compact and durable, and a toothpaste that comes in a small, travel-sized tube. Get some good floss as well, flossing is also an important part of dental hygiene. Nobody wants to go to a dentist, let alone going to a dentist in a foreign country. 

# Sunscreen

If you're going to be spending a lot of time outdoors on your backpacking trip, you'll also need to bring sunscreen. This will protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays, and prevent sunburns and other skin damage. Look for a sunscreen that has a high SPF, is water-resistant, and doesn't leave a greasy residue on your skin.

A good sunscreen can also be bought in the country where you are going to, so it is not needed to take it with you when you depart. But try to use sunscreen outdoors, else you'll be stuck inside as a lobster.

# Insect Repellent

Another essential toiletry for backpacking is insect repellent. This will help to keep mosquitoes, ticks, and other insects at bay, and prevent bites and the spread of diseases. I wish that I had this on my trips, but always forgot about it. There were so many times that I got eaten alive by insects, but I never learned. ^^"

# Conclusion

You don't need that much, so start small and whilst traveling you may find yourself in need of other things, but no worries as you will probably find them abroad as well. ;)
