# The Essentials: Electronics for Backpacking

*I am writing this article a lot later after making this video. This article will not be directly attached to this video but may still prove informative.*

When you're backpacking, it's important to pack light and only bring the essentials. This is also true for electronics, as carrying too many gadgets can add unnecessary weight and bulk to your backpack. 

However, there are some electronic items that are essential for backpacking, and can make your travels much easier and more enjoyable. Here are a few of the most important electronics to consider when planning your backpacking trip.

# Smartphone

A smartphone is perhaps the most important electronic item for any backpacking trip. Not only can it be used for making calls and sending messages, but it also has a wide range of other useful functions, such as navigation, translation, and access to travel information. Many smartphones also have high-quality cameras, allowing you to capture and share your travel memories.

Many people travel to be disconnected, but having some kind of connection in case of emergencies is always a good to have. If you really want to be disconnected, then just turn off your phone. I travel to be disconnected, however, having the option to book your next accommodation more easily through a website is a nice benefit of a smartphone.

# Portable Charger

A portable charger is another essential electronic item for backpacking. When you're on the go, it can be difficult to find outlets to charge your devices, and a dead phone or camera can be a major inconvenience. A portable charger allows you to charge your devices on the go, so you'll always have access to the technology you need. Also don't forget your regular charger just in case.

# Headlamp

A headlamp is a useful and versatile electronic item for backpacking. It can provide light in dark environments, such as hiking trails or tent interiors, and allows you to have both hands free for other tasks. Headlamps are also often more convenient and comfortable than handheld flashlights, as they can be easily worn on your head.

They are also quite small. You could have the discussion that your phone has a flashlight as well, but the power of the light is most of the time not strong enough. I always struggled whenever I had to use the flashlight of my phone and always wished I had a headlamp in those cases. Also using your phone for such a thing drains the battery quite quickly.
