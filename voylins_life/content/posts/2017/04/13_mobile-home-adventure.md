# Why a mobile home?

We have a big family and for as long as I can remember, we always went camping for our vacations. However, problems started to come when we got more dogs. 

Traveling with 6 dogs, and 3 kids isn't the easiest thing. That's why my parents went over from tents to a mobile home.

# With my family?

At this moment (2022) I think me and my family would probably travel by mobile home as well, just because you carry everything with you and we don't own a car and our apartment is not big enough to store a lot of camping materials which we may only use once a year.

That's why renting a mobile home here in Japan is probably the cheapest solution for us to go camping. 

# Bungalows?

A lot of camping grounds also have bungalows available, but in a mobile home we would have more freedom of where to park to have a better view.
