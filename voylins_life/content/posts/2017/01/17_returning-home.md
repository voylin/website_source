# Returning home

I returned home way earlier then expected. When I got home, nobody of my family knew that I was going back home, first I surprised my grandmother, then my brother and after that my parents. It felt good to be back home but I also realized, in those 2 months that I was gone, it felt like time had stood still. That's the moment that I realized that I should really go on more adventures, I don't want to only remember my time at home when it's time for me to leave this life.

## Why did I get home so soon?

I just felt that it was time. My mind had a good wake-up call, I had many new experiences and I started to feel too comfortable traveling which did not fit with my description of a big adventure as the intention of that was to get out of my comfort zone. So I went home, started studying Japanese properly and started saving up money for my future. I had a faint plan of where I wanted my future to go towards to, and I wanted to really properly work on it this time.
