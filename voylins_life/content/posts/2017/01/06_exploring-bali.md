# The wonders of Bali

I'll keep this one short and just advise you to look at the video. I had an amazing time and forced myself more and more to go out of my comfort zone. I even rented a scooter and made my way through the busy traffic there. Looking back now, the things which I did on that scooter were really irresponsible and I am glad I am still alive.

At one moment I almost fell with my scooter in front of a bus who was coming quite fast at me, and that because I wanted to pass a car who was blocking my way. ^^" I should have just waited patiently, like I am on vacation, why was I rushing myself??
