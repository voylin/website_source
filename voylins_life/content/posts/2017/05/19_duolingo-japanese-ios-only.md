# Duolingo Japanese only for IOS

*Update: Duolingo officially got released so this video is kind of out of date ... This article will just talk a bit about why IOS users are privileged.*

So whilst the Japanese course of Duolingo was in beta/alpha, only a selected few people got access to test the course. Of course there were some tricks you could do like changing the url to also get access to the course, same could not be done with the android version of Duolingo. For some reason they only allowed IOS users access. Why exactly? No idea, but there are a few things we could guess:

- Market demand: In some cases, the demand for an app on iOS may be significantly higher than the demand for the same app on Android. This may be because the target audience for the app is more likely to use iPhones, or because the app is more popular in countries where iPhones are more prevalent. In such cases, it may make sense for the developer to focus on iOS first, in order to meet the higher demand.

- Development resources: Developing an app for both iOS and Android can be a resource-intensive process, as it requires building and testing the app on two different platforms. A developer may choose to focus on iOS first in order to get the app to market faster, or to allocate their resources more efficiently.

- Ease of development: Some developers may find it easier to build and test apps on iOS, due to the more consistent hardware and software environment on iPhones. This can make it quicker and more cost-effective to develop for iOS first.

- Revenue potential: In some cases, an app may generate more revenue on iOS than on Android, due to factors such as higher app store fees or a more affluent user base. This can make it more financially attractive for a developer to focus on iOS first.

- Strategic partnerships: A developer may choose to focus on iOS first in order to establish a partnership with Apple or to take advantage of marketing opportunities through the App Store. 

It is also just possible that most developers only have Iphones (or at least the highest percentage eof developers have Iphones). ^^"

## These are just speculations

We will probably not hear the real reason, but I wasn't happy with their decision, but I can also understand it from a business perspective (Duolingo is still a company which needs to make money to keep existing.)
