# A dumb story

This is a story about probably my dumbest mistake when having gone to an airport. I still remember this as it was quite a big shock and I thought I would have gotten in a lot more trouble then I did.

Morale of the story, always check your pockets if something is still in there, or if there are any holes which may have dropped knives into the inner part of your coat. ^^"
