# My old room in Belgium

Since I moved out to live in Japan (2020), I have been missing my room as it was the place where I started with this youtube channel. I've had many fun, sad, despressing, excited and relaxing feelings in that room. We were living in that house since my 3 year of Junior high. Often the complaint came from me that the room was too small, but I was always able to make it work. It did not help of course that I wanted a double bed in that room, hahah what was I thinking??

All by all, I regret having chosen the color blue, but the color also made me more relaxed at times as my head can often go on a journey of its own.
