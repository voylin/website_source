# Why is checking your blood important for traveling?

*In the video I talk about some reasons, but in this article I want to expand a little upon that.*

It's not only important to check your blood before traveling, it is something which should be checked regularly. Once a year is advised by doctors. Here in Japan (where I live now) we need a medical check once a year, which is probably like this in most countries. During this check they also take some of your blood to see if your sugar or cholesterol has been too high. But it can also show other problems which you may not be aware of yet.

When traveling abroad it is important to take care of your health before embarking on your trip and during your trip. One way to do this is to have a blood test before you leave. Here are a few reasons why this is a smart idea:

## 1. Know your blood type

In Japan it's quite common that when you ask someone their blood type, they will be able to reply. Knowing this can be helpful incase you get in an accident. So this is quite good to know even when you are not traveling. I keep a card in my wallet with my blood type and some other info, so even if I don't speak the language, they will be able to get some basic health information about me through that card.

## 2. Check for health issues

A blood test can identify underlying health issues. Many medical conditions, such as diabetes and high cholesterol, may not have any noticeable symptoms. However, if left untreated, these conditions can have serious consequences, especially when traveling to a new and unfamiliar place. A blood test can help to identify these issues and allow you to seek appropriate treatment before you leave.

## 3. For vaccines

A blood test can help you determine if you need any vaccines. Depending on your destination, you may be at risk for certain diseases and infections that are not common in your home country. A blood test can help to determine if you are immune to these diseases and if you need to be vaccinated before you leave. This can help to protect your health and prevent the spread of disease.

# Conclusion

A blood test can provide peace of mind. Traveling can be stressful, and worrying about your health can add to that stress. By having a blood test before you leave, you can be reassured that you are in good health and can focus on enjoying your trip. By taking care of your health before you leave, you can ensure that you have a safe and enjoyable trip.
