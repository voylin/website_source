# Travel clothes

In general, it's important to choose travel clothes that are made from lightweight and breathable fabrics. This will not only make them more comfortable to wear, but also help them dry faster when you need to wash them on the go. In this video, I test out some different fabrics to see how quickly they dry, and share my findings with you.

## The key factor

One of the key factors to consider when choosing travel clothes is the type of fabric they are made from. Natural fabrics like cotton and linen are breathable and comfortable, but they can take a long time to dry, especially in humid climates. Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, on the other hand, are quick-drying and moisture-wicking, making them a great choice for travel.

In the video, I put several different fabrics to the test to see how quickly they dry. I washed some clothes and then hang it up to dry in a way that you would probably dry your clothes inside of a hostel/hotel. I checked on it periodically to see how much it had dried and took notes.

To see the results, check out the video. ;)

# Conclusion

This is an important consideration when choosing travel clothes, as you don't want to be stuck with wet clothes that take a long time to dry. But all by all, the results were kind of underwhelming as some indeed took longer to dry, but not that much longer that it would be a problem whilst traveling.
