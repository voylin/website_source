# The video

In the video I showed how I prepared my bag to travel around the world in winter. It is colder so you need sweaters and those things take up space. Still, I managed to keep the overall weight down to 7KG. Look in the video of how I did it, for the rest of this article I will mainly talk about the benefits about traveling light and why I like it so much.

# Why Traveling with a Single Backpack is a Good Idea

When planning a long-term trip or a world trip, it's easy to be tempted by the idea of packing multiple bags, each with its own specific purpose. However, after having traveled enough with a single backpack, I can confidently say that traveling with just one bag is the way to go, and what I prefer to do when going on a trip.

## Convenience and Mobility

First and foremost, traveling with a single backpack is incredibly convenient. When you only have one bag to worry about, you can easily move through airports, buses, and trains without being weighed down by multiple bags. This makes it easier to navigate busy streets and crowded public transportation, and also allows you to move quickly in case of any unexpected changes in your travel plans.

## Cost Savings

Another major benefit of traveling with a single backpack is the cost savings. Many airlines, trains, and buses charge extra fees for additional bags, so by only carrying one backpack, you can save money on transportation costs.

Additionally, when you have less stuff to carry, you can often opt for cheaper forms of transportation, such as local buses or hitchhiking, which can save you even more money. Also you don't have much space for souvenirs, so just don't buy any (or at least no big ones), this way you can save even more money. :D

## Simplicity and Minimalism

In addition to the practical benefits, traveling with a single backpack can also be a great opportunity to practice simplicity and minimalism. When you have limited space in your bag, you are forced to carefully consider what items you truly need, and let go of anything that is unnecessary. This can be a liberating experience, and can help you to focus on the present moment and enjoy your travels to the fullest.

You would be surprised with how little you need,even when traveling. Toothbrush, toothpaste and some clothes, and you are good to go. Even I who traveled often with a single backpack which was under 7KG still found that I took things with me which I never used.

## Improved Safety

Finally, traveling with a single backpack can also improve your safety while on the road. When you only have one bag to keep track of, it's easier to keep an eye on your belongings and prevent theft. Additionally, carrying a single bag can make you a less obvious target for pickpockets and other thieves, as you won't have multiple bags to draw attention to you.

# Conclusion

Traveling with a single backpack has numerous benefits, but the main thing I like about it is the fact that everything is always with me. Maybe it is my autism, but I always want to know for certain that I have everything with me, and I easily feel a difference in weight so I quickly find out if I am missing something. While it may take some time to adjust to the idea of traveling with only one bag, the rewards are well worth it.

It also can be quite time consuming to figure out what to take with you and to keep everything under a certain amount of kilograms, but it is so rewarding and feels so good when you succeed. So next time you plan a trip, consider ditching the multiple bags or suitcases and embracing the freedom and simplicity of traveling with a single backpack.
