*Vlog 3 - Bad weather = being creative*

I've got bored of staying inside because of the bad weather so I decided to work more on the drawing on my door. Of course there are multiple other things you can do when it's rainy weather, I just chose to be creative, here are some other things which you may consider doing:

1. Watch a movie or TV show;
1. Read a book or listen to an audio-book;
1. Play board games or video games;
1. Do a puzzle or craft project;
1. Write in a journal or blog;
1. Bake or cook a meal or dessert;
1. Practice an instrument or sing;
1. Do yoga or exercise at home;
1. Take a relaxing bath or shower;
1. Have a picnic indoors;
1. Visit a museum or art gallery;
1. Go to an indoor play area like Round 1;
1. Have a game night with friends or family;
1. Attend a class or workshop on a topic you're interested in;
1. Go shopping or browse stores;
1. Visit a local library or bookstore;

Enough things to do or come up with, so enjoy your time. Personally one of my most favorite things to do nowadays on rainy days is, open the window slightly to hear the sound of the rain better, get a cup of coffee or hot chocomilk and enjoy some study time.
