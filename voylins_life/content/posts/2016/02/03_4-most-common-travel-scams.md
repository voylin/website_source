# Most common travel scams

Whilst traveling, there’s nothing worse than falling into a scam and possibly losing a lot of money, ruining your vacations or in the worst case, getting stuck abroad because you have nothing left to afford your way back home nor contact home.

Nobody likes to get scammed whilst being on their well-deserved vacation. I mean, you finally have time to let go of your worries, but in fact, they get replaced by other worries. One way to not worry too much about getting scammed is by knowing the most common tourist traps and scams, this way you avoid a lot of misery on what’s supposed to be a fun trip.

## Taxi’s

So in the video, I talked about the concept of “broken taxi meters” and whilst this is the most common one that has to do with taxis, there are a couple of other things to watch out for as well. 

inform yourself well before you go on your adventure, as in some places it is better to take the official taxis than the people claiming to work for the official taxi service. A good example is in Bali, the moment you leave the airport and get into the arrival area, people will surround you asking if you need a taxi. These people charge almost 3 times as much as the official taxi services so the should be avoided. 

Look online on how the official taxi cars look in the country you are traveling to so you are prepared. But also, go to the taxi offices at the airport to arrange a taxi. This way you get the average price beforehand and you will be certain that they won’t drive in circles to crank up the price.

## Closed Attractions

For some reason, people really fall for this one. You can encounter people doing this on your way to major sightseeing spots like temples. They’ll try to start a conversation and once you start talking, you are being told in a friendly way that it’s some sort of holiday, so the place you are going to isn’t open today.

Then they try to get you in a tuk-tuk or taxi, drive you around, they will or charge you or make you buy something at a shop they are taking you to. It’s mostly a combination of both. But they will take you far away from tourist places so you feel like you have no other choice to go along with this scamming method.

## Free stuff

This one is simple if it’s free … then it’s probably even more expensive than what you would normally buy. However, sometimes things are free like free guides in Nara and Kyoto in Japan. This is, however, something you better look up beforehand and make a reservation for in advance. You can easily avoid this one by just looking up on google if there are any reviews or warnings about that “free stuff”.

Also never accept anything if they are trying to force it on you or directly give it to you, this will save you a lot of problems.

## Free WiFi

Yes, another free thing. Public wifi, don’t trust it nor use it unless you know that the source is reputable. Still, though, I wouldn’t recommend using them whilst login in on sites or apps, forget home banking from your phone or laptop on these wifi networks!! It has been proven  time and time again that they aren’t secure and that hackers like them a little too much

So that’s it for this article, the 4 most common scams, there are actually long lists of scams that can happen whilst traveling, but it varies from country to country. Do some research and contact your embassy site before departing. 

# Is "free" always a scam?

Just follow the golden rule: If something is too good to be true, it probably is. Do enough research, and use your head. People who scam also use their head and find new tactics all the time.
