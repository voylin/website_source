The idea of planning out your trip as a free-roaming backpacker may sound strange to some people but when planning you can actually bring your travel expenses down in the long run. However planning everything in detail is something I strongly dislike, as it can take the ‚Äúadventure‚Äù feeling away. 

Plan the basics and follow it not too strictly. With that said, let‚Äôs get going with my 5 tips!

## 1. Setting a budget:

It may seem like a no-brainer, but you wouldn‚Äôt be the first backpacker I‚Äôve met who I ran into who didn‚Äôt have any money left and has to survive from money family sends them.

When you want to become a backpacker, or you want to improve yourself, you have to learn how to budget. for every country have a daily budget of what you are planning on spending.

The things you should take in mind are:

- Food
- Hostel
- Daily activities
- Transport

Especially hostel and transport can take a big chunk out of your budget, hence why some backpackers travel with a tent instead. For transport, you could try hitchhiking or just walking everywhere like I do. But, if you want to choose the walking route you will have to take a good pair of walking shoes with you, a decent pair can cost around 150 euro to 200 euro.

That said, also your initial costs should be part of your budget, the only things I would recommend you cheap out on our shoes and the backpack.

Why the backpack you may ask?  Well, this can make your day of walking and carrying all your stuff around a lot smoother. Look up how to find a backpack your size and get a small backpack of around 40 liters so you don‚Äôt overpack and it can still fit as carrying on for the planes you may take.

## 2. Which places to see:

Go to my maps on google and select all things you kind of want to see whilst traveling, this will give you a good guideline which you can follow when moving from place to place. 

This is however not the way I would always recommend, as I would prefer to just select cities to go to. My first trip to Japan is the best example I can show you. I just booked my hostels in advance, 10 days in Kyoto, 1 full day in Nara, and 1 full day in Osaka. I arrived in those places and I just started walking around and I discovered that there are so many completely free things to see around those area‚Äôs which are always on the low ranking of websites which advise places to see, sometimes the places which I‚Äôve had discovered were things I couldn‚Äôt even find information about on travel websites.

So you can make a list of places to see, but again, don‚Äôt follow it too tightly. üòâ Look at what is capable but remember that you are on vacation, what‚Äôs the point of stressing yourself out?

## 3. Low or high season:

This can greatly impact your experience, as busy seasons may not be too enjoyable to walk around but low seasons may be too quiet for the backpackers who like to meet a lot of people and like to hang out. Also, hotel/hostel prices can change drastically. So which do you prefer, walking overheads or walking in deserted streets? Maybe a bit exaggerated, but it‚Äôs a good thing to consider. I‚Äôve always traveled during the low season and let me tell you, there‚Äôs no shortage of other backpackers to make friends with. ^^

Talking about seasons, be sure to check that you are not traveling somewhere during raining season, typhoon season, and what I like to call ‚Äòcooking season‚Äô. Second time in Japan I wish I came prepared for the heat which came to a point of almost being unbearable. So if you are a warm person from nature and prefer the cold, look it up or just deal with it that you‚Äôll get a tint and maybe a possible sunburn every now and then. :p

## 4. Research:

A big help can be looking up some basic words from the language which is spoken in the language you are going to. Maybe learn to introduce yourself? It gives an opportunity to start a conversation with the locals, but more importantly, it shows respect towards them. 

Learning the customs a bit is also important, the times I‚Äôve seen people getting mad here in Japan because foreigners didn‚Äôt put off their shoes has become uncountable. The hitchhiking sign that we use in Europe is offensive in Turkey and wouldn‚Äôt even work in Asia. In Asia, you do a waving sign towards cars you want to stop.

## 5. Your backpack:

I said it in the first tip as well but this really has the right to have its own tip. A backpack can break your back or save your back. If you travel with more than 4 kilo‚Äôs, then you should get a somewhat nice fitting back for your body structure, if you go over 10 kilo‚Äôs than I can assure you that you‚Äôve packed too much and will regret it later on. 

### The perfect weight

I would say it‚Äôs around 5 to 8 kilo‚Äôs as that is also the limit of carry-on weight by most airline companies. Now I can hear people saying already that during summer that‚Äôs possible but during winter it‚Äôs impossible. Well, I travel often during winter and I never exceeded 8kg with mostly staying around 7kg. 

### How do I do this?

You basically pack enough for 1 week, during winter I mostly only wear 1 sweater and wash it weekly. Weekly washing your clothes can make a big difference in weight, it gives some more washing work but that can be done in an evening while you chat with family or have a nice cup of sake or beer with other travelers you‚Äôve met.
