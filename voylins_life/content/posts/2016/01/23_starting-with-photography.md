# Starting with photography

Today I wanted to try out photography, to see how good or how bad I am xp I had these pictures saved somewhere but I lost them sadly enough. ^^" Oh wel, look on my instagram if you want to see if my skills became any better hahah.

I've had to learn quite a few things and I am still learning today on how to improve my pictures. Here is some advice. ;)

# Why photography?

Photography is a rewarding and creative hobby that allows you to capture the world around you in a unique way. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced photographer, there are always new things to learn and ways to improve your skills. In this article, we'll give you some tips to help you get started with photography.

# Start with the basics:

Before you dive into more advanced techniques, it's important to understand the basics of photography. This includes understanding how your camera works, the exposure triangle (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO), and the different types of lenses available. There are plenty of online resources and tutorials that can help you learn these concepts, so take some time to brush up on the basics before moving on.

# Experiment with different settings:

Once you understand the basics of photography, it's time to start experimenting with different settings on your camera. Don't be afraid to try out different aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings to see how they affect the final image. This will not only help you get a feel for how your camera works, but it will also allow you to capture different types of shots and explore your creative potential.

# Invest in a good quality camera and lens: 

While it's possible to take great photos with a smartphone, investing in a good quality camera and lens can make a big difference in the quality of your images. Look for a camera with manual settings, so that you can have more control over the final image, and choose a lens that is appropriate for the type of photography you want to do.

Remember that a better camera won't make you a better photographer, so you still need to work on your skills to take beautiful and rewarding photos. When you feel like you want an image quality boost, buy a better camera, preferably with a lens which can be changed. This will help you with taking different kind of pictures. Closeups with a lot of *bokeh*, or a wide angle lens for beautiful landscapes where everything is in focus.

# Take your time:

Photography is not a race, so don't feel like you need to rush through a shot. Take your time to compose the image, adjust your settings, and get the shot you want. This will not only help you produce better images, but it will also make the process of photography more enjoyable and rewarding.

# Join a community:

Finally, consider joining a photography community or club. This will give you access to other photographers who can provide advice and guidance, as well as opportunities to share your photos and learn from others. Many cities and towns have local photography groups that meet regularly, or you can join an online community to connect with photographers from around the world.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, photography is a creative and rewarding hobby that can provide endless opportunities for learning and self-expression. By following these tips, you can get started with photography and begin exploring the world through the lens of your camera.
