# My big adventure

The departure on my big adventure was quite a big one, as I quit my job to go on this adventure. What many people, including my family, didn't know was that I had a mission, a goal for this trip. People thought I just wanted to travel, but there were more reasons behind this.

## How I decided

I wanted to set some things on a row as I was uncertain where to go for my future path. After my first trip to Japan I felt conflicted in many ways. My first trip to Japan was normally not going to be a solo trip, but a trip with a close friend. But after that friend canceled the plans, I started doubting some parts of my future as well as I had been making plans with that friend, other than that trip. More things went on top of the pile of worries once learning more of that friends situation and it became too much.

So after I came back from my first trip, 1-2 weeks later, I went to my boss and asked to leave the company at the end of my contract. They were not happy but they understood my situation. I did some bad things towards that friend that I still regret to this day, but looking back to it I realized there were other ways I could have handled that situation, maybe a future was not possible, but at least a friendship. But I have the tendency to ruin friendships, that's why I don't have any friends left anymore. So to all friends which I've hurted, my apologies. For all the friends who abandoned me, sorry, it was probably me as well who did something wrong.

## My reason

I wanted to escape from my comfort zone, escape from daily life to put my mind on zero and start thinking again. It may sound like a bad reason, but with close to zero friends, no close friends left, and serious questions of where I'd end up if I continued how I was doing, I really felt like my life needed a big twist to feed my mind with more experiences and wisdom.

## The people I've met along the way

During that trip I met some amazing people, and had some great experiences. It also made me realize that I wasn't happy with how my life had been going. Everyday behind the pc, chatting with people, whilst I could have gone out more on adventures and actually have a great time. The time I spend with people online teached me many things, the time I spend with people in real life teached me things, but also gave me experiences.

The people I met all gave me important life lessons and helped me find my way to make my future more stable and actually make some future plans.

# Conclusion

This big adventure was something I really needed but even when I got back home, my mind was still figuring things out. I did it easy with work when I got back, giving myself enough time to put everything in a row. Figuring out how I wanted my future to go. I already made one giant step during this big adventure, but there were still other things which I wanted to work out as well.

I have regrets for things I did in the past, and I could have handled many situations differently as well. But I am happy of where I am now, and that's thanks to that big adventure. So my advice for everybody is: "When you feel stuck in too many ways and can't see your path anymore, take a break from everything and step out of your comfort zone. Give your mind room to breath and cleanup.".
