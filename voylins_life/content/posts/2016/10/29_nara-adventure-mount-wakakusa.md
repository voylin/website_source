# A hike in Nara

One of the first missions I wanted to achieve was hiking in Nara. Probably a bad idea to do this during summer as the mosquitos were trying to eat me alive and I really did not bring enough water at all. It was quite an experience and a good punch to start good on this big adventure to to test my limits and wake myself up from the slumber in which my mind had been the past years.
