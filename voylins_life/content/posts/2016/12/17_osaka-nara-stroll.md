# Nara Light festival

A yearly festival which is really worth going to. It basically feels like you are entering Disneyland but then without the attractions. I was really happy with the people I've met there and the life lessons they gave me. Often in these videos about my Big Adventure, I don't really show or say why I was actually on that trip. It was to sort out my own life a little bit. That time in Nara with those people was a very big help to me and I am very grateful for the time we spend together.

# Strolling through Osaka

This is probably one of my most favorite things to do. I really dislike busy areas, but in Osaka you can find so many places with almost no people, but with still a nice atmosphere. Osaka is a vibrant and bustling city, filled with fascinating sights, delicious food, and friendly people. One of the best ways to experience the city is by simply taking a leisurely stroll through its streets and neighborhoods.

## Street Food

One of the best things about Osaka is its incredible street food culture. The city is known for its delicious and affordable snacks, from steaming bowls of Takoyaki (octopus balls) to crispy, savory Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake). As you walk through the city, you'll be tempted by the mouthwatering smells and sights of these tasty treats, and you'll have the opportunity to try as many as you like.

If you prefer eating in a normal restaurant, the you are still in luck as Osaka is also known as the kitchen of Japan with many very good options of restaurants to go to. Just stroll around and enter a random restaurant, and you'll be certain that you'll have a delicious meal.

## Unique Architecture

Osaka is also a city of unique and beautiful architecture. As you walk through the city, you'll see a mix of traditional and modern buildings, each with its own unique character. One of the most notable examples is the Osaka Castle, a stunning 16th century castle surrounded by moats and gardens. Other notable architectural sights include the Umeda Sky Building, with its futuristic design, and the Tsutenkaku Tower, which offers stunning views of the city.

Around Tennoji you also have Haruka's, Japan's tallest building. There is even a free garden on one of the floors with a nice view over the city. Although nowadays many of the buildings are copy paste, you can still find unique buildings in Osaka, sometimes in places where you least expect it.

## Locals

Another great thing about strolling through Osaka is the opportunity to meet and interact with the locals. The people of Osaka are known for their warmth and hospitality, and many of them will be happy to chat with you, share a snack, or offer directions. As you walk through the city, you'll likely encounter many friendly locals who are eager to help you make the most of your visit.

If you are learning Japanese, then be ready for a challenge as Osaka Dialect is one of the most difficult Japanese dialects in my opinion. I've been living in Osaka for some years now (this part is written in 2022), and I still can not 100% grasp what people are saying to me when they use the locale dialect. ^^"

## Shopping

Finally, strolling through Osaka is also a great opportunity to do some shopping. I personally am not really a big fan of shopping, but I can understand why some people may like it. The city is home to many markets and big shopping centers, where you can find everything from traditional crafts and souvenirs to the latest fashion and electronics. Some of the most popular shopping districts include the Dotombori area, known for its neon-lit shops and restaurants, and the Shinsaibashi-suji shopping arcade, which offers over 600 meters of shops, restaurants, and bars.
