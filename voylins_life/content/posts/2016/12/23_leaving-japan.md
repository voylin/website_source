# Leaving Japan

Leaving Japan was difficult and I was going to go to Bali next. But before even arriving in Bali I had already booked my next plane ticket to go back to Japan. Something (actually more someone) was pulling me back there. That person was also the reason why I went 8 times in total to Japan with my 9th time being to move here. 

## Why leave if I was going directly back to Japan?

I had booked that plane ticket to Bali before my adventure started, my original plan was to travel all over Asia and then continue traveling through Europe by bicycle to get back home. However, plans got changed whilst I was in Japan the first time. I don't regret that decision, but I sometimes wondered how it would have gone to have been traveling for over a year.
