# Goals in life

So I am revisiting this old video in December 2022. I won't change the date of this article and instead update this every now and then. You can see what my goals were in 2015 when watching the video, and on this page you can see how my goals have changed.

## December 2022 

It is december 2022, the 9th the be exact. I am living in Japan now, I'm married and I have a kid, all things which I did not expect to happen at the making of this video. My life has turned itself around quite heavily but in a positive way. It has been an adventure with many ups and down. Did some things I am not proud of and regret daily, but there are also many things that I would not have done any differently.

### Goals now

My goals now is to find a more stable job within Japan. We discussed the options of moving to Belgium, however that would be quite problematic for work related reasons, financial reasons, + even though Belgium education is not bad, we think Japanese education will be better for our kid together with the way we will raise our kid. This may raise many eyebrows as Japanese education may seem very old fashioned and such. But when things will go sideways, I think we will have to make the decision to change things again.

Furthermore, one of my goals is to invest more time in Youtube, Game Development, programming and enjoying life. I have been stressed out a lot because of work recently and there is no improvement in sight. There will be a meeting soon and maybe big changes will happen, I really hope so, but it's probably going to be just a zoom call in which we read a PDF together ... like usual. Companies here in Japan are very inefficient, sadly enough.

So goals for now:
- Try to have a more relaxing life;
- Be more positive like I used to be;
- Invest more time in my hobbies;
- Enjoy life with my kid and wife.

See you next year for and update! ^^/

# How about life long goals?

My main goal which I am striving for is being fluent in Japanese and possible passing the N1. It's no secret that I am not a big fan of the JLPT, but it's the one which is recognized all over Japan, kind of like the Eiken test for English.

Another goal is to move to the countryside and start farming, sadly that is not such a profitable journey to undertake. If we have another source of income which could help us and provide stability for our life, then I am out of the busy city and buy myself a nice old house in the mountains to renovate.
