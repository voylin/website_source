# A day-trip by bike

This is the first video I really put the effort into making. But I find that the contrast between the time that I made this video (now 6 years ago) and now, is quite big ^^"
Posting a Christmas letter the special, and personal way :D

It was a fun day-trip and now 6 years after making this video, I feel kind of nostalgic about Belgium and the relaxing area where I used to grew up in. This was before my first trip to Japan and at that time I was actually planning on making something like a caravan to attach to my bicycle and travel around Europe with it. ^^" Times change very fast and often, don't they?

# Do I miss riding my bike in Belgium?

Of course I miss it. The roads are (mostly) in better condition and a lot safer as most places have bicycle lanes. Here in Japan (where I live now (2022)) roads are less safe, very narrow, and not much has been done to the roads to support bicycles, forcing them onto the sidewalks where you get the extra challenge of not hitting people who are walking. Not to mention that the sidewalks are in very bad condition if you need to ride on them with a bicycle.

## How about my bike?

I have a new bike here in Japan, but the problem with this one is that it's not my old bike. My old bike had been with me through a lot, even when I got hit by a truck, and it drove a lot smoother. My bicycle now is okay ... but I may replace it once we move to a house and have more parking space. I often drive long distances and on rough terrain, so it would be nice to have one with some suspension (especially on the front wheel).
