# 梅まつり – Ume Matsuri

So Ume Matsuri, which basically means “Plum Festival”. It looks similar to Sakura, but never say that to a Japanese person or else you’ll have to hear an hour-long explanation of why it’s different and why Sakura is better ^^”

Just sharing a video of me having a fun time with some friends before the heat of the summer nearly killed me a few months after this. There is quite a lot to talk about when comparing Sakura against The Ume Matsuri as the latter one isn’t well known among foreigners/tourists. Something I would like to address in a video next year ^^
