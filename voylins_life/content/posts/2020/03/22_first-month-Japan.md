# Visa trouble

It has been quite an adventure so far. This whole move to Japan to start living and working here has been kind of difficult, to say the least. That is because of 2 things: Corona and Paperwork. Right now we are almost done with the paperwork. But because of the Corona-virus, the international post has stopped in Europe. The problem is that I still need some official documents from Belgium which need to be sent to me here in Japan.

I must admit that the whole paperwork is quite troublesome and stressful, part of that is also because most information about Japanese visa stuff which is posted online is wrong, not fully correct, outdated or is for a totally different situation. For people who want to know, I don’t have a university degree and not really planning on getting one any time soon.

However, this makes things kind of difficult as Japan really loves that piece of paper which said that you spend 3-4 years longer at school instead of actually working and gaining work experience (which in my opinion is still the best way to learn).

# Any videos?

As for video’s, I want to wait to upload until I got settled, as of now we don’t have our own house yet, I still need a job, my Japanese still needs a lot of work and time is really scarce right now.

For now, I will work on this site, keep myself busy with papers and learn Japanese while hiding away in our room to study Japanese. :p

# Quick summary

All be all, my first month in Japan has been quite a roller-coaster and I don’t regret moving here at all. The only thing I regret is that my Japanese is still not fluent nor good enough to be able to talk with random strangers or to ever make friends here. Most of my days are being spent in my room studying which I hope to change soon as my list of things I want to do keeps growing and growing.
