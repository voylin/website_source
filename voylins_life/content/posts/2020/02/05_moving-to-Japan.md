# Preparing to leave Belgium

This whole journey was something I wanted to film as much as possible however, I ended up being way too busy with family, friends, paperwork, … so I couldn’t record as much as I wanted to.

Preparing to move out is already a big undertaking, however, I was moving to almost the other side of the world! The packing was troublesome, to say the least and there are still many things still at my parents’ house in Belgium.

# Corona

Yes, I moved kind of during the wrong time with this whole Corona event which is happening all over the world, but at the time of moving it wasn’t as serious yet and I thought things would already be solved by the next month. We are 2 months later now and the Olympics are canceled and some people aren’t even allowed to leave Tokyo anymore now.

# Packing and plane

As I said, many things are still at home, but I’m glad that I chose Finn-air as they allowed 2 suitcases at no extra cost, I used to take KLM every single flight, but recently they have gotten a whole lot more expensive and the worst part is: YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR LUGGAGE NOW!!

I find that very discouraging for KLM to do such a move, but hey, we have money and they have planes, and sadly enough we don’t have enough money to buy a plane ourselves. 

So I used 2 suitcases and my backpack, so I have enough clothes with me and the necessary stuff to “survive”, but I wish I had taken some of my books with me as well as I don’t have my study materials with me anymore now

# The plane ride and arriving

It honestly felt so good to step on the plane, before arriving at the airport, I always get nervous because I don’t like being late, especially because that plane ain’t gone wait for me but to sit in the plane before departing. Luckily my family got me there good on time and we were able to spend a little bit more time before I went through the gate.

I felt sad leaving my family behind, but I also realized that if I would keep living in Belgium that I probably won’t be able to be as happy as to where I am now. Still, I can’t thank my family enough for raising me the way I am and for all the care and support they have given me.

On the plane I found people to talk to again, like usual, and I was also not able to fall asleep again, like usual. Luckily this time I had a free update to an extra leg space seat!! it was the first time that I was truly sitting comfortably in a plane.

When I arrived in Japan I was being waited up, we head home and I don’t quite remember what we did anymore as the jet-lag kicked in, yet again.

# What's up next?

In the next couple of month’s, I’ll probably be busy with paperwork and studying Japanese. Not sure yet what kind of a job I will be able to do here, but I hope I will have better working conditions here compared to Belgium.

As for videos, I would love to make more video’s but I’m not exactly living alone right now so finding the time and space to film could be rather tricky. I have however filmed 2 new video’s here which I would love to publish, but I haven’t yet been able to start editing them yet as my time is being taken up by more important things at this moment.

I hope to be publishing again by April!
