# How to type Japanese one linux

To be able to type Japanese on Linux you will need Ibus Anthy
Use this command and follow the instructions from the video :3

```
  sudo apt-get install ibus-anthy
```

*I may update this video in the future with more detailed instructions as Anthy is getting outdated. I would really recommend Mozc instead.
