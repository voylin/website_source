**Thank you for visiting our website.**

I’m Voylin’s wife who will be helping to post articles on this site. I’ d like to share how our life is and share our experiences for the people who are interested or need some information.

I am quite a beginner to maintain/post on this kind of website but will try my best … hope you will enjoy it! ^-^

## Some explanation by Voylin:

This website is made with Hugo, so posting articles and such is not as 'simple' as using wordpress by example. This is why the number of posts by my wife will be limited, probably.

When she posts articles she will type in Japanese which will be good for the people amongst you who are learning Japanese!
